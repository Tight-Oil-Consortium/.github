### What is TecTOC?
Technology of Tight Oil Consortium (TecTOC) was launched to create a link between the cutting-edge, yet practical, applied research performed by Tight Oil Consortium (TOC), and subsurface energy industry technology and service needs. TOC is an industry- and government-sponsored multi-disciplinary research group, hosted at the University of Calgary, which has been advancing field- and laboratory-based reservoir characterization and evaluation methods and technologies for low-permeability (“unconventional”) hydrocarbon reservoirs since 2011.
