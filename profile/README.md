### What is TecTOC?

Technology of Tight Oil Consortium (TecTOC) was launched to create a link between the cutting-edge, yet practical, applied research performed by Tight Oil Consortium (TOC), and subsurface energy industry technology and service needs. TOC is an industry- and government-sponsored multi-disciplinary research group, hosted at the University of Calgary, which has been advancing field- and laboratory-based reservoir characterization and evaluation methods and technologies for low-permeability (“unconventional”) hydrocarbon reservoirs since 2011.

### What is TOC?

Tight Oil Consortium (TOC) is a multi-disciplinary consulting team of reservoir characterization and engineering experts. We focus on different scales of reservoir characterization ranging from pore to core scale studies in the laboratory and well to field scale analyses using production and geological/geophysical data.

### What is TEC?

TEC develops and applies advanced field- and laboratory-based technologies to the characterization and evaluation of Subsurface Transitional Energy Pathways (‘STEPs’). STEPs are pathways that enable the transformation of energy from fossil fuel-based to zero carbon and include:

- Geological CO2 Storage (GCS)

- Hydrogen Production and Storage (HPS)

- Geothermal Energy (GE)

- Critical Elements for the Energy Transition (CEET)

TEC specializes in STEPs hosted in “unconventional” reservoirs such as deep unmineable coals, low-permeability sedimentary (clastics and carbonates), and igneous and metamorphic rocks requiring specialized technologies to evaluate and develop.
